## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external dependencies required (uses only Python standard library)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vasuraman2005/ai-cs-chatbot.git
cd ai-cs-chatbot
```

2. Run the chatbot:
```bash
python chatbot.py
```

## 💡 Usage

### Starting the Chatbot

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

### Sample Interactions

```
You: What is machine learning?

AI-CS Assistant: 
📚 Topic: MACHINE LEARNING

Definition: Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Types:
  • Supervised Learning
  • Unsupervised Learning
  • Reinforcement Learning
  • Semi-supervised Learning

Applications:
  • Image Recognition
  • Natural Language Processing
  • Recommendation Systems
  • Predictive Analytics
```

### Available Commands

- Type your question about AI or CS topics
- `help` or `?` - Show available topics
- `exit`, `quit`, or `bye` - Exit the chatbot

## 🔍 Supported Topics

| Topic | Keywords |
|-------|----------|
| Machine Learning | ml, machine learning, ai |
| Deep Learning | deep learning |
| Neural Networks | neural network, nn |
| Natural Language Processing | nlp, natural language |

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Knowledge Base**: The chatbot uses a structured dictionary containing information about various AI and CS topics
2. **Query Processing**: User queries are normalized and matched against topic keywords
3. **Response Generation**: Relevant information is formatted and presented to the user
4. **Interactive Loop**: Continuous conversation until the user decides to exit

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add more topics and subtopics
- [ ] Implement web interface using Flask/Django
- [ ] Add external API integration for real-time information
- [ ] Include code examples for programming topics
- [ ] Add conversation history and context awareness
- [ ] Deploy as a web application
- [ ] Add multilingual support
